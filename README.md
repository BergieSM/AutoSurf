Welcome to AutoSurf!

To get started, do stuff.  Thank you!
(AKA, I will fully fill this out shortly, just making a readme for now.)

Basically, get an IDE such as Eclipse, install a java sdk (I just use Oracle java, plain and vanilla), download the webdriver executable, and pick two of those to install and the last to go in the directory with the git repo clone (rhymes with pharmaceutical).
In eclipse, import the project, and rightclick on Testcases class, run it as a java application.  It will ask for the master password, just type in the latest.  Watch it run!
